Hi! I’m **Ali Moameri**— a Master’s student in Software Engineering. My research and projects primarily focus on:

+ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
+ Large Language Models (LLMs)
+ Information Retrieval
+ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

I love diving deep into the technical challenges—and then writing about them to share what I learn.
